# ROAD: RNA Origami Automated Design

The ROAD software package automates the main design steps of the RNA origami method: model building, folding path analysis, and sequence design. The design process starts by specifying an 'RNA blueprint': a text-based diagram that encodes all Watson-Crick base pairs (bp), sequence constraints, pseudoknots, base stacking at junctions, and 5´ to 3´ strand direction.
